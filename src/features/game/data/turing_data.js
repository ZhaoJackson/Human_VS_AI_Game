    "human": "There's a lot of mental self-sabotage that goes on, where I find myself instinctually turning to depressive habits, like wanting to isolate myself all day. I overthink things every day. I worry that someone hates me, or that when I say something I’m being rude. I find myself apologizing to people and they tell me I’m fine, but then it’s awkward, so it’s self-fulfilling.",
    "ai": "Living with depression often feels like moving through thick fog. Everything takes more effort, even the smallest tasks. I show up to my day, but a quiet heaviness follows me from morning to night, making it hard to feel present or connected. Even on the good days, I’m constantly negotiating with my energy and reminding myself that showing up, in any form, is still a kind of strength.",

I know if I grab onto an ice pack and hold it with both hands, then naturally I start to focus on the cold of the ice pack. It forces you to switch from emotional emergency mode to mindfulness in your hands.",

You dread the possibility of a follow-up question, knowing that explaining a trigger might force you to relive the trauma right there in a sterile office hour just to justify a simple accommodation.

    "ai": "Most people don't realize that PTSD isn't just about flashbacks or nightmares, it's also the weird stuff like flinching at certain smells or going completely blank when someone asks you a simple question that somehow connects to the trauma. Your body reacts before your brain even registers what's happening, so you might be snapping at someone or feeling your heart race without consciously knowing why. It's exhausting to constantly be on alert for triggers you didn't even know you had until they hit you out of nowhere.",

Sometimes I don't realize just how heightened I've become, but my cat will usually alert me that I'm overstimulated. And that's a good clue for me to say to myself, wait. I need to stop, check in, try and regulate, and figure out what's going on.",
    "ai": "For me, the biggest help is getting the worries out of my head and onto paper so they stop looping on repeat.

",

It feels dismissive when they tell us to \"just get a planner,\" because the problem isn't that we don't know what to do, but that our brains won't let us execute the task until the adrenaline of a crisis kicks in.

    "ai": "As a grad student in my late 20s living with bipolar II, the most helpful thing has been building routines that anchor me when my mind wants to drift in opposite directions. Keeping a consistent sleep schedule and breaking my work into manageable, predictable blocks gives me a sense of stability that my mood doesn’t always offer on its own. Just as important has been being honest with a small circle of people—my therapist, a close friend, my advisor—so I don’t have to pretend I’m fine on days when I’m clearly not. That mix of structure, support, and self-awareness doesn’t make the disorder disappear, but it makes the day-to-day feel more navigable, even during the quieter lows or the subtle hypomanic hum beneath everything.",
